# FirebaseChat
Firebase-backed group chat with autodeleting messages.

The chat firstly was created at Hackaton during the course of one night. Later the login flow was improved and a few features were added, like groups and autodeletion. It simply deletes entities from date base, so nobody can read it after 5 seconds.

Users can login using Facebook account as well, as creating new user. This process backed by Firebase. The chat screen uses JSQMessageViewController for displaying chat messages. Sending images and uploading to Firebase were added later.
